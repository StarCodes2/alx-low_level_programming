# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
## Files:
- **search_algos.h:** Header file included in all .c files contains function prototypes and struct defination.
- **0-linear.c:** Contains a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
- **1-binary.c:** Contains a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
- **2-O:** Contains the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n
- **3-O:** Contains the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n
- **4-O:** Contains the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n
- **5-O:** Contains the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n
- **6-O:** Contains the space complexity of a given function/algorithm
- **100-jump.c:** Contains a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Jump search algorithm, and the function's helper function
